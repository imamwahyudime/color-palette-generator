# Color Palette Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random color palettes. It's built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features:

- Generate a new palette of 5 random colors with a single button click.
- Display the hex code for each generated color.
- Click on any color box to copy its hex code to the clipboard.

## Usage:

1. Save the HTML code as `index.html`.
2. Save the CSS code as `style.css` in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Save the JavaScript code as `script.js` in the same directory as `index.html`.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Click the "Generate Palette" button to see a new set of colors. Click on a color box to copy its hex code.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements (Optional Ideas):

- Implement different color generation methods (e.g., monochromatic, analogous, triadic).
- Allow users to specify the number of colors in the palette.
- Add a "lock" feature to keep certain colors while regenerating others.
- Include accessibility checks (e.g., contrast ratio).
- Allow users to save or export palettes.
